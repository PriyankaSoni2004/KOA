# ü¶¥ Knee X-ray Image Classifier üñ•Ô∏è

## Overview üìã

This Flask application utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify knee X-ray images into Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades. It offers various CNN architectures, including EfficientNet, Inception, Xception, and ResNet50, along with six different combinations of preprocessing techniques to enhance classification accuracy.

## Features üöÄ

- **Classify knee X-ray images into KL grades** using different CNN architectures.
- Implement six distinct combinations of preprocessing techniques for data augmentation:
  1. Data Augmentation using Image Data Generator
  2. Data Augmentation using Image Data Generator and Clahe
  3. Data Augmentation using Image Data Generator and HE
  4. Data Replication and CLAHE
  5. Data Replication, Image Cropping, and CLAHE
  6. Data Augmentation using Albumentations Library and Clahe
